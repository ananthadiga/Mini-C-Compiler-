# Mini-C-Compiler-

   Compiler is a program that reads a program written in one language, called source language and translates it in to an equivalent program in another language, called target language. It reports errors detected during the translation of source code to target code. Source program can be of any programming language. Here our source program is ANSI C program
The first phase of the compiler, Lexical Analyzer, is being implemented by using LEX tool provided with Linux.
In second phase, Syntax Analyzer, is being implemented by using Yacc tool provided by Linux.
In third phase, Semantic Analyzer, and the fourth phase, Intermediate Code Generation, are carried out as the part of action corresponding to the production rules in the parser. 

This project describes the overview of building a mini C compiler to check syntax errors and to see if our compiler parses the program successfully.
